// Responsible for creating the redux store–and any associated work like middleware.

// The ideas here and in createReducer are directly from Dan:

// The difference is in how I inject reducers using withReducer()
const initializeStore = () => {
  // createStore returns a plain object so we'll mess with it after creation.
  const store = createStore(
    // See rootReducer.createReducer for more info on this. Calling it without
    // a param creates a reducer with whatever is in rootReducer.
    createReducer(),
    composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(thunk)),
  );

  // Create an object for any later reducers
  store.asyncReducers = {};

  // Creates a convenient method for adding reducers later
  // See withReducer.js for this in use.
  store.injectReducer = (key: string, reducer: object) => {
    // Updates the aysncReducers object. This ensures we don't remove any old
    // reducers when adding new ones.
    store.asyncReducers[key] = reducer;
    // This is the key part: replaceReducer updates the reducer
    // See rootReducer.createReducer for more details, but it returns a function.
    store.replaceReducer(createReducer(store.asyncReducers));
    return store;
  };

  return store;
};

export default initializeStore;
